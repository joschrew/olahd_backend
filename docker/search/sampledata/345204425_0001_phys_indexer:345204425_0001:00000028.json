The story of the Licinio - Sextian plebiscites,  in - spite of all the additional elements brought in after the analogy of the second century,  is not essentially different in this respect.  We learn that there was some trouble with the draft in 370 and then again that the final acceptance of the plebiscite by the Senate in 367 was preceded by seditious movements which led almost to a secession Another famous instance of later times is the military strike of 343,  which,  according to Livy ceded the Genucian plebiscites.

This of course does not mean that in the earlier period a plebiscite must necessarily have been connected with riots and civic strikes.  Sometimes the expression of the will of the plebs may have sufficed to make the patricians give in.  Sometimes the plebeians may have yielded to the resistance of the patricians without starting violent commotions.
