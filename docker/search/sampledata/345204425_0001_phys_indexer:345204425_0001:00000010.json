In the first place it is not easy to see why it was so essential for the plebeians to have the consulship restored if they wished to pass a law regarding debts,  since,  at that time,  the consular tribunes were the highest magistrates and since this office was already accessible to plebeians.  Why should it have been more difficult for three plebeian consular tribunes — and,  cording to Livy there had been that many or even more plebeians in some of the six - men colleges of consular tribunes in earlier years — to have such laws put to a vote against the possible resistance of three patrician gues than for one plebeian consul to do this against the possible resistance of his one patrician colleague?  And if it is argued that there was a greater chance of finding one patrician consul at some time who would give in to the entreaties of his plebeian colleague than of overcoming the resistance of two or three patrician consular tribunes,  why not wait for the passage of debt laws and land laws until the plebeian consulship was secured?

But the explanation is very hard to believe.
