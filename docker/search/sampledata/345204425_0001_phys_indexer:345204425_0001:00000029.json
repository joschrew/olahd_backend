Perhaps it would be more correct to say that probably,  just like the institution of the plebeian tribunes itself,  they represented,  so to speak,  a piece of legalised revolution. \nThe question of how the plebiscites in the early period acquired the force of laws is not quite so easy to answer.  But on the basis of the clusions reached so far it does not appear likely that the answers given by Mommsen and Niccolini are correct.  It appears that since 449 at the latest,  probably since 494,  if that date is correct,  the tribunes had claimed the right \" to deal with the plebs \" ( cum plebe agendi ),  i.  e.  formally to elicit the opinion of the majority of the plebeians,  and that this right was,  ever reluctantly,  admowledged by the patricians.  The agitation of the tribunes in the years 377 to 367,  according to Livy,  started with assemblies of the plebeians convoked by the tribunes.  Certainly these assemblies must have expressed their opinions in some way.  If then Mommsen's theory is correct,  namely that plebiscites acquired the force of laws only if the proposals of the tribunes had been approved by the Senate before they were put to a vote in the concilium plehis,  we would have to assume that the plebs was twice called upon to express its opinion,  once before the Senate had given its assent and once afterwards.  According to Livy the Senate,  in order to make the plebiscite valid,  would even have had to give its auctoritas again after the second vote All this is not very probable,  and the tradition on which this explanation is based is suspect because belonging to the Sullan era.

These laws,  according to Livy contained a number of reaffirmations of previously accepted principles that had been disregarded under the decemvirs and some new legal provisions most of which had been the subject of the demands of the plebeians in their blies as they had been convoked by the plebeian tribunes.  In addition,  according to Livy they also provided ut quod trihutim plebes iussisset populum teneret.  If this means that from then on all plebiscites were to have equal force with laws it is in conflict with everything that Livy tells in the next several books,  and,  of course,  also specifically with the tion that a law to this effect was passed a century and a half later in 287.
