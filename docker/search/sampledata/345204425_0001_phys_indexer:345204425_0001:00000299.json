Its length is just under 100,  000 words and it is a piece of succinct expression.  Invited by the Publisher to write the biography of a distinguished Roman,  Gelder selected Pompey,  for the very good reasons which he has set out in his Introduction.  Notes are restricted,  in the main,  to a bare statement of the ancient sources on which the ments in the text depend and from Geberts account there emerges a Pompey who is nicely contrasted with Caesar and who is as different from Mommsen's Pompey on the one hand as he is from Eduard Meyer's on the other.  Gelzer's Pompey,  indeed,  is far more convincing than Mommsen's or Meyer's ; he is a man with no farreaching — certainly,  in most of his career,  no personal — designs in Roman poHtics,  who in Rome wanted little more than 'die Stellung eines Reichsfeldherrn',  as long as the Senate would keep on good terms with him ( pp.  151,  261 f.  ),  and whose genius in strategy and organization,  unsuspected at other times,  was brilHantly shown mediately the opportunity was given for its display.  As Geber writes ( p.  164 ) of his discharge of the last of the many commissions which he was to carry out with real effectiveness,  the corn commission of 57 B.  C. ,  ^Wenn sein Verhalten in der stadtrömischen Politik oft nicht anders als phlegmatisch bezeichnet werden kann,  so finden wir hier,  wo es zügig zu organisieren galt,  wieder die alte Energie'. \nWhen,  after his return from exile in this same year 57 B.  C. ,  Cicero described Pompey { Post red,  ad Quir.  ^ 16 ) as Vir omnium qui sunt,  fuerunt,  erunt,  virtute,  sapientia gloria princeps ',  there was in the encomium a slight palpitation of hysteria.  Yet when he had said nine years earlier at the climax of a vivid piece of oratory ( De imp.  Cn,  Pomp, , ,  62 ),  'Quae in omnibus hominibus nova post hominum memoriam constituta sunt,  ea tam multa non sunt quam haec quae in hoc uno homine vidimus',  this wild extravagance of language must have seemed to many who heard it to be little more than a sober expression of truth.  If achievement was any criterion,  Pompey was 'Magnus' indeed in 67 B.  C. ,  and the year 62 B.  C. ,  when he returned to Italy from the East,  perhaps marked the end of that greatness.  Yet this is just the time when we begin to see Pompey in the clear,  if often distorting,  mirror of Cicero's correspondence.  And that,  as Gelzer points out in his Introduction,  is the dilemma in which Pompey's modern graphers will always find themselves.  There is no De hello civilis no De hello AfricOy no De hello Hispaniensi^ no De hello piratico^ no De hello Mithridatico from Pompey's own hand.  Pompey's weakness in politics later is baffling enough,  but at least it is a well - documented weakness ; Pompey's strength is strategy and in imperial organization is attested but not,  in surviving sources,  by the sort of witnesses whom we should like to have.  It is this. \n","fulltext_not_analysed":"296\nKe : iensionen\nMatthias Gelder : Pompeius,  München,  1949,  F.
