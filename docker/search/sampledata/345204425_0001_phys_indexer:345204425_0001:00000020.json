It is a habit of many ancient historians,  and,  as a comparison of other parts of the work with Polybius shows,  of Livy also,  to quote the author whom they have followed in the main narrative,  only if and when they disagree with him in regard to some particular point and wish to correct his version with the help of evidence derived from elsewhere.
