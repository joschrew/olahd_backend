Hoffmann tries to refute Cornelius's theory with three main arguments.  He shows that Cornelius's assumptions concerning the size and the increase of the size of the Roman army are not supported by a careful interpretation of the tradition and quite improbable in themselves.  In this respect Hoffmann is undoubtedly for the most part right.  In fact,  he might have added that the two parts of Cornelius's theory do not fit together very well.  For the increase in the Roman army,  according to Cornelius,  was very rapid but steady.  The increase of the number of the tribunes on the other hand,  according to the fasti whose evidence Cornelius accepts,  was not steady.  The two increases therefore can hardly be quite so directly related to eadi other as Cornelius believes.

He argues that the Romans could not know beforehand what wars they would have to wage in a given year and that therefore the number of consular tribunes to be elected cannot have been determined by the necessities arising from these wars.  Now it is quite true that wars cannot always be predicted,  except perhaps by those who plan them,  and perhaps even not always by the latter.  But this has not prevented nations and cities from preparing in advance for conflicts whidi they expected to break out or of which they at least suspected that they might break out.  Perhaps one may argue that this general observation does not apply to the small scale world of Rome and its neighbors in the fifth century.  But is this so certain?  The steady expansion of the Roman territory since ca.  430 B.

It is true that here also Cornelius has tried to reconstruct the events and their connection with one another in greater detail than the condition of the tradition permits.
