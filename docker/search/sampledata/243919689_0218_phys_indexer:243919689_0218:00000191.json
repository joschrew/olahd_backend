For each absolute point P,  Np is transitive on the absolute points off P ^.\nProof.  By Lemma 10 it will suffice to prove that Np is transitive on the hyperbolic lines through P.  By Lemmas 11 and 12 there are exactly 2 or 3 iVp-orbits of points on P ^ according as P is symplectic or unitary,  namely,  one orbit consisting of P alone,  one consisting of absolute points on P- *-, and one,  which is vacuous when P is symplectic,  consisting of the ordinary points on P ^. Hence there are precisely 2 or 3 iVp-orbits of hyperplanes of P ^. One of these orbits consists of the non-degenerate hyperplanes of P- *-, i.  e. , the hyperplanes P,  where I is a hyperbolic line through P ( the others are : the hyper planes where m is a totally singular line through P,  and the hyperplanes r \\ P ^ where X is an ordinary point on P- *-).
