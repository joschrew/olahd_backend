Transitivity in the unitary plane\nIn the case of a unitary plane P,  Auta ( P ) and its subgroup T ( P ) are doubly transitive on the absolute points.

Then as in the proof of Theorem 2,  a jt? - Sylow subgroup S 0 Î Gp rs T ( P )^ P an absolute point,  must have order ^ go- On the other hand,  the assumed transitivity of G implies that the number ql ( gl + 1 ) of the flags in question divides | G |, It follows that go divides G : G rs T ( P ) = G T ( P ): P ( P ), and hence that go divides Aut ( F ) : T ( V ) = 2r ( go— 1 ).
