But it makes a very great difference whether the innovation was made in order to make room for the plebeians,  as Livy says,  or whether it was introduced for other reasons but in consequence of a development which at the same time meant an increase of the power of the plebeians,  as Hoffmann contends.

Or shall we assume that they first demanded the creation of a four man presidency in the hope of getting access to it,  and then,  when failing to succeed in this way,  for the same reason had it increased to six but still for some time did not succeed in getting elected?
