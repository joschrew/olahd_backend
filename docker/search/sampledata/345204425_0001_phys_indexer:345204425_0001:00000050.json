Two of the five letters refer to specific dates.  Number 19 records an incident that occurred in the theater between July 6 and 12,  the period of the scenic games in the ludi Apol - linares.  Number 21 describes Pompey's contio on July 25.  Letter 18 was written shortly before 19 ; both letters mention demonstrations at the gladiatorial show of Gabinius just before the ludi Apollinares Letter 18 also belongs to the time of the professio of tribunitial candidates,  which was at least twenty - four days before the election.  Letters 20,  21,  and 22 were written in close succession.  All of them contain answers to inquiries made in a recent letter ( or letters ) from Atticus.  Letter 20 reports Bibulus' postponement of the comitia. \nLetter 22 is not much later than 21,  which describes Pompey's contio of the 25th,  but it has all the indications of an ominous event.  The event was,  I think,  Clodius' election to the tribunate,  fully reported to Atticus perhaps by an accompanying copy of the election results.  Pompey^s assurances to Cicero about Clodius take on a new définiteness : снт hoc ( that is,  Clodius ) Pompeius. . .  vehementer egit,  cum diceret in summa se perfidiae et sceleris infamia fore si mihi periculum crearetur ab eo quem ipse armasset cum pleheium fieri passus esset.  In urging Atticus to return,  Cicero no longer refers to the comitia : sed totum est in eo si antequam ille ineat magistratum.  The election could have been held on any of the comitial days from the 26th to the 31st ; it should probably be dated not earlier than the 28th,  since otherwise Cicero would have delayed the despatdi of number 21 until after the comitia. \nWe have then two letters,  18 and 19,  written close together,  the latter dating July 6—12,  and three letters,  20—22,  written immediately before and after July 25.  Letters 23 and 24 should,  I think,  be placed between these two sequences.

The consalutatio forensis perhonorifica given to Curio ( i8,  i ) I attribute to demonstrations at the gladiatorial show whidi would have taken place in the Forum.  Cicero next mentions the hisses whidi greeted Fufius,  a praetor who was an adherent of Caesar.  Cf.  19,  2,  gladiatoribus qua dominus qua advocati sihilis conscisd.  I am not convinced by L.  A.  Constans' effort to prove that this gladiatorial show was not given by tho consular candidate,  Gabinius.  See his discussion of ad Ati.  II 24,  3 Rev.  de Phil.  Ser.  3,  V ( 1931 ) 240 f. \n9.  My dating of the Vettius affair in mid - July is not inconsistent with the evidence of secondary authorities.

Plutarch ( JLucul.  42,  7 ) seems also to place it after the vote on Pompey's acta.  Appian in a confused account { B.  C.  II 12 ) puts the story after the vote on the lex Сатрапа.
