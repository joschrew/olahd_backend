Letter 23 was taken to Atticus by Numerius Numestius whom Atticus had commended to Cicero.  In 20,  1 and 22,  7 ( two letters which I date after 23 and 24 ) Cicero answers Atticus' inquiries about Numestius.

Since Vettius in his charges in the senate involved a consular candidate,  and since in the public meeting the next day he mentioned a candidate for the praetorship,  some connection of the incident with the elections seems clear.  Caesar had been showing deep concern for the election of magistrates on whom he could depend.  Under the lex Сатрапа ( ad Att.  II 18,  2 ) he had required all candidates to take oath in a public meeting that they would not impugn the land grants under the Julian laws,  and thereby he had eliminated one candidate for the tribunate,  an upright man who would not take the oath.
