As pointed out before,  the early history of the plebiscite is closely connected with the secessions and similar seditions and semi - seditious breaks.  The first regulated and,  so to speak,  official expression of the will of the plebs in their struggle with the patricians is the resolution by which the plebeians declared their tribunes inviolable and obligated themselves by an oath to defend their sacrosanctitas against any and all attempts that might be made on it,  even if made in the exercise of the legitimate coercive power of the ordinary magistrates.  This,  if it happened in this way — and something of this kind must certainly have happened — was clearly a one - sided resolution of the plebs ; and it is not very likely that the plebeians asked the permission of the Senate before taking it.

No further legislation was sary,  and in the course of time the sacrosanctitas became an inherited constitutional principle the origin and legal basis of which did not matter any more But most of the important plebiscites of later times are not of this kind.  Land laws,  debt laws,  laws regarding the accessibility of the consulship to plebeians,  etc.  cannot be established by a one - sided action of one part of the population in the same way in which this was probably the case with the rule concerning the sacrosanctitas of the tribunes.  In regard to these other plebiscites of the early period,  therefore,  two tions have to be asked : first,  by what force or pressure the legalisation of a plebiscite could be brought about,  and,  second,  in what form this isation of a plebiscite could or would ordinarily take place? \nThe answer to the first question is given by ancient tradition,  and,  what is more,  by a part of ancient tradition which,  as shown above,  is older than the Gracchan period : the pressure was exerted by secessions,  seditions,  riotous outbreaks,  military and civil strikes.  Thus,  according to Livy not more than four years after the second secession in 445 B.  C.  there were again riotous disturbances in connection with the Canuleian\n42.
